# SEES App
An iPhone app designed for CPP SEES students to view academic information, calendar events, and office information that are located in a Firebase database instance. This data can be controlled, edited, and updated by SEES office personnel using the [SEES Admin iPad App](https://github.com/robertparsonsdev/SEESAdmin).

The SEES app was designed, built, and tested using Swift and programatic UI in Xcode.

- In order to use the SEES app, a student must be logged in to view who their academic advisor is and their office. Major curriculum information can be viewed for any Science major. This links the student to the Cal Poly Pomona website where those documents are stored.
- For each major, the curriculum information can be viewed for each option in that major.
- Once the student is viewing their desired document, they are able to share it and send it anywhere they like.
